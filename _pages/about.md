Hi! I am a Research Scientist at Bytedance Seed Team, working on building the best in-house code LLMs. My current focus is on large scale LLM mid training and post-training. I was previously a MSCS student at UIUC, with research experience in LLM evaluation, factuality and ethics. Before that, I finished my bachelor degree at Zhejiang University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
