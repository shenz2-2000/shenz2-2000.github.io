Hi! I am a second-year Master student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. Kevin Chang. Before that, I finished my bachelor degree at Zhejiang University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

I am particularly interested in improving and evaluating large language models, and building LLM agents. 

I am excited to join Bytedance AML as a Research Scientist at San Jose starting from this summer.
